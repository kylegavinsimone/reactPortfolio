        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        I'm just a huge nerd, father of 4 children, and I've been married for 13 years. I am from Haines Alaska, a small town up north. I love games of any kind. I've decided to aim for video game creating in the long term,but right now I am looking for a job in data entry for companies. I live in Mesa Arizona. In our technological world coding and programming are always going to be a very high in demand skill, so I look forward to working with you!
